.SH NAME
geocalc \- Calculate various geographic data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geocalc
[\fIOPTIONS\fP] <\fICOMMAND\fP> [\fIARGS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Calculates various geographic data. Input values are provided through command 
line arguments, and the result is printed to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Show a help summary.
.TP
\fB\-\-license\fP
Print the software license.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Be more quiet. Can be repeated to increase silence.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Increase level of verbosity. Can be repeated.
.TP
\fB\-\-selftest\fP
Run the built\-in test suite.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fP
Print version information.
.SH COMMANDS
All coordinates must be entered as decimal degrees, using the format 
\fB[\-]xxx.yyyyy\fP. Only metric units are supported; distances are printed in 
meters, and distance inputs are also expected to be in meters.
.PP
Some arguments are specified as a coordinate. One format is allowed: 
\fBlat,lon\fP where \fIlat\fP and \fIlon\fP is a number in the range \-90..90 
and \-180..180, separated by a comma. The decimal comma must be a period, '.'.
.TP
\fBbear\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP>
Print initial compass bearing (0\-360) between two points.
.TP
\fBbpos\fP <\fIcoor\fP> <\fIbearing\fP> <\fIdistance\fP>
Calculates the new geographic position after moving \fIdistance\fP meters from 
the position \fIcoor\fP in direction \fIbearing\fP. Negative values for 
\fIdistance\fP are allowed, to make it possible to calculate positions in the 
opposite direction of \fIbearing\fP.
.TP
\fBcourse\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP> <\fInum\fP>
Generate a list of \fInum\fP intermediate points on a direct line between two 
locations. If a value of 0 is specified, only the begin and end positions are 
printed.
.TP
\fBdist\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP>
Calculate the distance between two geographic points, using the Haversine 
formula. The result (in meters) is printed to standard output.
.TP
\fBlpos\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP> <\fIfracdist\fP>
Prints the position of a point on a straight line between the locations, where 
\fIfracdist\fP is a fraction that specifies how far along the line the point 
is. 0 = start position, 1 = end position. \fIfracdist\fP can also take values 
below 0 or above 1 to calculate positions beyond \fIcoor2\fP or in the opposite 
direction from \fIcoor1\fP.
.SS Exit status:
.TP
0
No error.
.TP
1
Some error occurred, for example invalid coordinates or numbers were provided.
