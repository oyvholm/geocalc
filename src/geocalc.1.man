.SH NAME
geocalc \- Calculate various geographic data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geocalc
[\fIOPTIONS\fP] <\fICOMMAND\fP> [\fIARGS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
geocalc is a program that calculates various geographic data. It receives 
parameters and values via the command line, and prints strict, stripped-down 
values to standard output. This makes it suitable for use in scripts and quick 
manual calculations.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Show a help summary.
.TP
\fB\-\-km\fP
Use kilometers instead of meters in the input and output.
.TP
\fB\-\-license\fP
Print the software license.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Be more quiet. Can be repeated to increase silence.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Increase level of verbosity. Can be repeated.
.TP
\fB\-\-selftest\fP
Run the built-in test suite.
.TP
\fB\-\-valgrind\fP
Run the built-in test suite and use additional Valgrind checking.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fP
Print version information.
.SH COMMANDS
All coordinates must be entered as decimal degrees, using the format 
\fB[\-]xxx.yyyyy\fP. Only metric units are supported; distances are printed in 
meters or kilometers, and distance inputs are also expected to be in meters or 
kilometers.
.PP
Some arguments are specified as a coordinate. One format is allowed: 
\fBlat,lon\fP where \fIlat\fP and \fIlon\fP is a number in the range \-90..90 
and \-180..180, separated by a comma. The decimal comma must be a period, '.'.
.TP
\fBbear\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP>
Prints initial compass bearing (0\-360) between two points.
.TP
\fBbpos\fP <\fIcoor\fP> <\fIbearing\fP> <\fIdistance\fP>
Calculates the new geographic position after moving \fIdistance\fP meters from 
the position \fIcoor\fP in direction \fIbearing\fP. Negative values for 
\fIdistance\fP are allowed, to make it possible to calculate positions in the 
opposite direction of \fIbearing\fP.
.TP
\fBcourse\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP> <\fInum\fP>
Generates a list of \fInum\fP intermediate points on a direct line between two 
locations. If a value of 0 is specified, only the begin and end positions are 
printed.
.TP
\fBdist\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP>
Calculates the distance between two geographic points, using the Haversine 
formula. The result (in meters or kilometers) is printed to standard output.
.TP
\fBlpos\fP <\fIcoor1\fP> <\fIcoor2\fP> <\fIfracdist\fP>
Prints the position of a point on a straight line between the locations, where 
\fIfracdist\fP is a fraction that specifies how far along the line the point 
is. 0 = start position, 1 = end position. \fIfracdist\fP can also take values 
below 0 or above 1 to calculate positions beyond \fIcoor2\fP or in the opposite 
direction from \fIcoor1\fP.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
No error.
.TP
1
Some error occurred, for example invalid coordinates or numbers were provided.
