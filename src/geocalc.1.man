.SH COMMANDS
All coordinates must be entered as decimal degrees, using the format 
\fB[-]xxx.yyyyy\fP. Only metric units are supported; distances are printed in 
meters, and distance inputs are also expected to be in meters.
.TP
\fBbear\fP <\fIlat1\fP> <\fIlon1\fP> <\fIlat2\fP> <\fIlon2\fP>
Print initial compass bearing (0-360) between two points.
.TP
\fBbpos\fP <\fIlat\fP> <\fIlon\fP> <\fIbearing\fP> <\fIdistance\fP>
Calculates the new geographic position after moving \fIdistance\fP meters from 
the position \fIlat\fP,\fIlon\fP in direction \fIbearing\fP. Negative values 
for \fIdistance\fP are allowed, to make it possible to calculate positions in 
the opposite direction of \fIbearing\fP.
.TP
\fBdist\fP <\fIlat1\fP> <\fIlon1\fP> <\fIlat2\fP> <\fIlon2\fP>
Calculate the distance between two geographic points, using the Haversine 
formula. The result (in meters) is printed to standard output.
